MULTITHREADING

1. What is multithreading?
Multithreading allows us to execution of mutliple threads simultaneusly , thread is the smallest unit of the process which can get executed independently , multithreading helps us to improve the performance of the application.
2. We can achive mutiplethreading in java by 2 ways :
 by extending Thread class and override its run () method 
 ex: 
 class MyThread extends Thread {
	public void run() { }
		MyThread my = new MyThread();
		my.start();
		}
 by implementing Runnable interface override its run method ,passed its instance as thread constructor.
 ex:
 class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
	public void run () {}
	MyRunnable my = new MyRunnable();
	Thread thread = new Thread(my);
	thread.start();
	
3. Why Multithreading?
Interviewers expect you to say:

1. Better CPU Utilization

Threads run in parallel, keeping CPU busy.

2. Faster Execution

Multiple tasks run simultaneously.

3. Improved Application Performance

Background tasks (logging, file upload, audit queue processing, etc.) run without blocking main logic.

4. Used in Real Projects

Producer–Consumer

WebServer handling multiple requests

Async tasks (email/SMS sending)

Thread pool executor in Spring

🟦 Step 1: What is a Thread? (Basic Foundation)
👉 Simple definition:

A thread is like a small worker inside your program that performs a task.

💡 Real-Life Example:

Imagine you have a kitchen with:

1 cook → single-thread

3 cooks → multi-thread

More cooks = more work done in parallel.

🧠 In Java:

A Java program normally has multiple threads:

Main thread – runs your main method

GC thread – runs garbage collector

User defined threads – you create them

🟦 Step 2: Why do we need Threads?
Without threads:

Your program works one task at a time.

With threads:

Your program can do multiple tasks at the same time.

Real Example:

A web server:

Thread1 → login request

Thread2 → payment request

Thread3 → fetch profile

Thread4 → send OTP

So each request gets its own thread.

🟦 Step 3: How to create a Thread? (Very Easy)

There are 2 ways.

Way 1 → Extending Thread class
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start(); // starts new thread
    }
}

🔥 Important:

start() → starts a new thread

run() → contains the code to execute

Never call run() manually

Way 2 → Implementing Runnable (Best method)
class MyTask implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Task running...");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread(new MyTask());
        t.start();
    }
}

Why Runnable is better?

Because Java doesn’t allow multiple inheritance.
You can extend one class only, so using Runnable is flexible.

🟩 Step 4: Thread Lifecycle (Very Important)

Threads go through different states:

NEW → RUNNABLE → RUNNING → WAITING/BLOCKED → TERMINATED

Simple explanation:

NEW: thread object created

RUNNABLE: start() is called but waiting for CPU

RUNNING: using CPU

WAITING: sleeping/waiting for lock

TERMINATED: done

🟦 Step 5: Thread Methods (Very Simple Today)
Method	What it does
start()	start new thread
run()	thread task
sleep(1000)	pauses thread
join()	wait for other thread
yield()	give chance to others
interrupt()	interrupt sleeping thread
🟧 Step 6: Understanding Race Condition (Very Important)
What is race condition?

When two or more threads try to modify the same data at same time, data becomes inconsistent.

Example:

Two threads increasing balance:

Thread1: balance = balance + 100
Thread2: balance = balance + 100


Result might be:

200

OR 100

OR wrong value

This is where synchronization comes.

🟥 Step 7: Synchronization (Beginner Level Today)
Definition:

Synchronization means only one thread can access code at a time.

synchronized void increment() {
    count++;
}


This prevents data corruption.
